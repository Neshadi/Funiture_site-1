# AR Furniture Viewer - Usage Guide

## Overview
This furniture e-commerce website now includes Augmented Reality (AR) functionality that allows users to view 3D furniture models in their real-world environment using their mobile phone's camera.

## How It Works

### 1. For Customers (Viewing AR Models)
1. **Browse Products**: Navigate to any product detail page that has a 3D model
2. **Find QR Code**: Look for the QR code on the product page
3. **Scan QR Code**: 
   - Use the "ðŸ“± Scan QR" button in the navigation menu, OR
   - Use your phone's camera app to scan the QR code directly
4. **Enter AR Mode**: The AR viewer will open automatically
5. **Place Model**: Tap "Enter AR" and point your camera at a flat surface to place the furniture

### 2. For Administrators (Adding 3D Models)
1. **Access Admin Panel**: Log in as an admin and go to the Add Product page
2. **Upload 3D Model**: Use the "Upload 3D Model" section to upload GLTF/GLB files
3. **Save Product**: The 3D model URL will be automatically included in the product data
4. **QR Code Generation**: QR codes are automatically generated for products with 3D models

## Technical Requirements

### For Users
- **Mobile Device**: iOS 11+ or Android 7+ with AR capabilities
- **Browser**: Chrome (Android) or Safari (iOS) with WebXR support
- **Camera**: Back-facing camera with AR support
